# election_analysis
This project was done as a way to audit election results from various counties. In order to complete the audit a python scrip ran through an Excel sheet containing all of the ballot information. This script counted the total number of votes, the various candidates who received votes, and the number of votes received by each and their percentage of the total vote as well as determining the winning candidate through the total vote and percentage vote and wrote the information out to a text file. However, in order to get a better understanding of the election a separate task was undertaken to determine where the various votes were coming from. In order to accomplish this additional coding was added to the base script that would track the voter turnout for each county, and from that the percentage of the total vote that the county in question accounted for, as well as the county with the highest turnout.
